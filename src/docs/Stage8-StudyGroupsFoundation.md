## Type Definitions

**Files Created:**
- `src/types/studyGroups.ts`

**Types Defined:**

- UI component integration testing

## Storage Integration (Ready for Future Stages)

The foundation includes preparation for file sharing capabilities:
- File storage fields in group_messages table
- Storage bucket references in database schema
- File upload tracking integration
- Thumbnail and preview support structure
- Group-specific storage folder organization

## Security Implementation

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- User authentication requirements for all operations
- Group membership validation for sensitive operations
- Privacy level enforcement (public vs private groups)
- Creator permissions for group management
- Member-only access to group content

## Performance Optimizations

- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Separate member count queries to avoid GROUP BY issues
- Caching-ready service layer structure
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Lazy loading and pagination support (ready for large datasets)

## Next Steps (Future Stages)

The foundation is ready for:
1. **Real-time messaging** (Stage 9) - Database and service layer ready
2. **File sharing** - Storage integration points established
3. **Group management** - Admin controls and member management
4. **Notifications** - Real-time updates infrastructure in place
5. **Advanced search** - Full-text search and recommendation system
