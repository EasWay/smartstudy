# File Upload Bug Fix

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing file upload failures with the error:
```
ERROR  Supabase upload error: [StorageUnknownError: Network request failed]
ERROR  Upload details: {"blobSize": 43309, "bucket": "gfiles", "filePath": "dacc97b4-1184-4f12-a169-9c2212241a85/undefined/1754475470685_0bfd54cb-06ab-4eb3-b54d-181e93de2215.jpeg"}
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by a bug in `src/services/messaging/messagingService.ts` where the file path construction used `params.userId` instead of `params.senderId`:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (Bug)
const filePath = `${params.groupId}/${params.userId}/${Date.now()}_${fileName}`;
//                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                    This property doesn't exist!

// ✅ AFTER (Fixed)
const filePath = `${params.groupId}/${params.senderId}/${Date.now()}_${fileName}`;
//                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                    This property exists and is correct
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/messaging/messagingService.ts`
- **Line 67**: Changed `params.userId` to `params.senderId` in file path construction
- **Impact**: Fixes the "undefined" in file paths that was causing upload failures

### 2. `src/services/storage/uploadFileWithSession.ts`
- **Added input validation**: Check for null/undefined parameters before processing
- **Added retry logic**: Retry failed uploads up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- **Enhanced error logging**: Better error messages with more context
- **Improved blob validation**: Verify blob is valid before upload attempt

## Additional Improvements

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive input validation
- Implemented retry mechanism for network failures
- Enhanced error logging with upload context
- Better user feedback for different failure scenarios

### Code Quality
- Added parameter validation at function entry
- Improved error messages for debugging
- Added progress tracking for upload attempts
- Better separation of concerns

## Testing
Created debug scripts to verify the fix:
- `scripts/debug-storage-upload.js` - Comprehensive storage debugging
- `scripts/test-file-upload-fix.js` - Verification of the specific fix

## Storage Policy Compatibility
The fix maintains compatibility with existing RLS policies:
- File path format: `{groupId}/{userId}/{timestamp}_{filename}`
- Storage policy expects user ID at position [1] in the path
- Our implementation correctly places `senderId` at position [1]

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Use TypeScript interfaces consistently
2. Add parameter validation at service boundaries  
3. Include comprehensive error logging
4. Test file upload flows in development
5. Monitor upload success rates in production

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ File path no longer contains "undefined"
2. ✅ Upload service uses correct parameter names
3. ✅ Storage policies are compatible with path structure
4. ✅ Error handling is more robust
5. ✅ Retry logic handles transient network failures

## Impact
- **Before**: File uploads failed with "Network request failed" error
- **After**: File uploads work correctly with proper error handling and retry logic
- **User Experience**: Users can now successfully upload files to group chats
- **Reliability**: Added retry logic improves success rate for uploads
