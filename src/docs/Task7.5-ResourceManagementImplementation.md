# Task 7.5: Resource Management and Deletion Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of resource management and deletion functionality as specified in task 7.5 of the Ghana Education App project.

## Requirements Addressed
- **2.7**: Delete functionality for user-uploaded resources
- **7.4**: Bulk file operations (delete, move, organize)
- **7.5**: Remove files from storage when resources are deleted
- **7.6**: Update user storage usage statistics

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced ResourceService

#### New Methods Added:
- `deleteResource(resourceId: string)`: Deletes a single resource with file cleanup
- `deleteMultipleResources(resourceIds: string[])`: Bulk deletion with success/failure tracking
- `getUserResources(userId?: string)`: Fetches user's uploaded resources
- `updateUserStorageUsage(userId: string, sizeChange: number)`: Updates storage usage statistics
- `getStorageStats(userId: string)`: Retrieves storage usage statistics

#### Key Features:
- **Ownership Verification**: Ensures users can only delete their own resources
- **File Cleanup**: Removes files from Supabase Storage when resources are deleted
- **Thumbnail Cleanup**: Removes associated thumbnail files
- **Storage Tracking**: Updates user storage usage when files are deleted
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of storage and database errors

### 2. Enhanced ResourceCard Component

#### New Props:
- `onDelete`: Callback for delete functionality
- `showDeleteButton`: Controls delete button visibility
- `isSelected`: Selection state for bulk operations
- `onSelect`: Callback for selection mode
- `selectionMode`: Enables bulk selection mode

#### Features:
- **Individual Delete**: Delete button for single resource deletion
- **Selection Mode**: Checkbox-based selection for bulk operations
- **File Size Display**: Shows file size information
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected state styling

### 3. New ResourceManagementScreen

#### Features:
- **Storage Usage Dashboard**: Visual progress bar showing storage usage
- **Individual Resource Management**: Delete individual resources
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple resources for bulk deletion
- **Selection Mode**: Toggle between normal and selection modes
- **Storage Statistics**: Real-time storage usage tracking
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh resource list and storage stats

#### UI Components:
- Storage usage header with progress bar
- Action bar with selection controls
- Resource list with management capabilities
- Confirmation dialogs for delete operations

### 4. Enhanced ResourcesScreen

#### New Features:
- **Management Navigation**: Link to ResourceManagementScreen
- **Header with Actions**: Clean header design with management button

### 5. Navigation Updates

#### Changes Made:
- Added `ResourceManagement` screen to `ResourcesStack`
- Updated navigation types to include new screen
- Configured proper header styling for management screen

### 6. Storage Service Enhancements

#### New Methods:
- `updateUserStorageUsage(userId: string, sizeChange: number)`: Updates user storage usage
- Enhanced type safety for file operations

#### Features:
- **Storage Tracking**: Automatic storage usage updates on upload/delete
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for storage operations

```

## Key Implementation Highlights

### 1. Secure Deletion
```typescript
// Ensures user owns the resource before deletion
const { data: resource, error: fetchError } = await supabase
  .from('resources')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', resourceId)
  .eq('uploaded_by', user.id) // Ownership check
  .single();
```

### 2. File Cleanup
```typescript
// Removes file from storage
if (resource.file_path) {
  const { error: storageError } = await supabase.storage
    .from(bucket)
    .remove([resource.file_path]);
}
```

### 3. Storage Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Updates user storage usage
if (resource.file_size) {
  await this.updateUserStorageUsage(user.id, -resource.file_size);
}
```

### 4. Bulk Operations
```typescript
// Handles multiple deletions with success/failure tracking
const result = await ResourceService.deleteMultipleResources(resourceIds);
// Returns: { success: string[], failed: string[] }
```

## User Experience Features

### 1. Storage Dashboard
- Visual progress bar showing storage usage
- Color-coded warnings when approaching limits
- Real-time usage statistics

### 2. Selection Mode
- Toggle between normal and selection modes
- Visual feedback for selected items
- Bulk action controls

### 3. Confirmation Dialogs
- Confirmation for single resource deletion
- Bulk deletion confirmation with count
- Clear success/error messaging

## Testing

### Test Coverage:
- Resource deletion functionality
- Bulk deletion operations
- Storage usage updates
- Error handling scenarios
- User authentication checks

### Test Files:
- `resourceDeletion.test.ts`: Comprehensive tests for deletion functionality

## Security Considerations

1. **Ownership Verification**: Users can only delete their own resources
2. **Authentication Checks**: All operations require authenticated users
3. **Database Policies**: Leverages Supabase RLS policies for additional security
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unauthorized access attempts

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately while background operations complete
2. **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk deletion processing
3. **Storage Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup prevents orphaned files
4. **Caching**: Storage statistics caching for better performance

## Future Enhancements

1. **File Organization**: Folder-based organization system
2. **File Versioning**: Version control for important documents
3. **Advanced Filters**: Filter resources by type, date, size
4. **Export Functionality**: Export resource lists and metadata

## Database Setup Required

⚠️ **Important**: Before using the resource management features, you need to set up the required database tables and columns.

### Quick Setup
Run the database setup script to get the SQL commands:
```bash
npm run setup-db
```

### Manual Setup
See the detailed setup guide: `src/docs/DatabaseSetup.md`

### Required Changes
The implementation requires these database additions:
1. **Storage tracking columns** in the `profiles` table (`storage_used`, `storage_limit`)
2. **Resources table** for storing educational materials
3. **Bookmarks table** for user bookmarks
4. **File uploads table** for tracking uploads
5. **RLS policies** for security

## Error Resolution

The errors you're seeing:
```
ERROR column profiles.storage_used does not exist
ERROR column profiles.storage_limit does not exist
```

These will be resolved once you run the database setup SQL commands in your Supabase dashboard.

## Conclusion

Task 7.5 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive resource management and deletion functionality. The implementation includes secure deletion, bulk operations, storage cleanup, and usage tracking, providing users with complete control over their uploaded resources while maintaining data integrity and security.

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the database setup using `npm run setup-db`
2. Execute the provided SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor
3. Test the resource management features
4. Verify storage tracking works correctly
